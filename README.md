# Activity: Markdown Class Schedule

- Use the template document `ClassScheduleActivity.Rmd` to create a document that describes **at least three classes** you are currently taking.  (Note: If you are taking fewer than 3 classes, you may describe jobs or other responsibilities for additional entries, what matters is that you get some practice writing an R Notebook)
- Students may help from one another, but each student must submit his/her own original work to be graded.
- You should be able to get by with pretty basic use of Git/GitHub, but you will want to learn and configure these tools as soon as possible.  You should expect to make at least 3-4 commits (one to initialize the project, one after each class you describe, others for editing etc)
- Help each other, share Rmd tips, post questions/answers/syntax to Piazza

### Grading

This activity is worth a total of 10 points, make sure to follow this rubric:

- [1 point] you must have at least three "commits" in GitHub as you work through the assignment  
- [5 points] Submit as an R Notebook to Canvas (i.e., RStudio automatically generates with ".nb.html" extension and embeds the Rmd)  
- [1 point] Level 3 heading (###) for each class title  
- [1 point] One or two sentences of standard narrative text--NOT a comment in a code chunk--about why you're taking each class  
- [1 point] link to a webpage relevant to the class--a Wikipedia page is fine  
- [1 point] embed a relevant picture/figure for each class shown within the document
